/* mtangle.h - provides a set of utility routines to handle headings and
   angles which are in the range [0..ANGLE_RANGE). All arithmetic on
   angles are done with modulo ANGLE_RANGE arithmetic.
   
   A heading (THeading) is considered clockwise from North. That is heading 0
   is due north and is divided into ANGLE_RANGE degrees.
   
   An angle (TAngle) is considered clockwise from some other heading. That is,
   an angle is the clockwise deflection from another heading, and should not be
   understood to necessarily be a deflection from north. Note
   that a heading is simply an angle relative to due north.
   
   A deflection (TDeflection) is an angle that can be either a deflection
   clockwise or anticlockwise. Like TAngle the angle to which a deflection
   is relative to is not specified. */
