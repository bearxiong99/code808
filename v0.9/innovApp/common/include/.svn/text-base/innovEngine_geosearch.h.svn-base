/** @addtogroup Geosearch
    This module provides the ability to perform searches for data within
    the map.  Collectively these functions perform the task of geocoding.
    The geosearch functions can be thought of as applying a series of 
    filters to the data so that only these items that match the search 
    criteria are passed through.  Reverse geocode functions can be 
    used to snap to roads near to certain lat / long locations.
    
    @note
    Maps can be encoded in a number of different code pages.  It is 
    important to use the code page conversion function 
    language_platformToInternal to ensure that the correct text data is 
    supplied to the map engine geocoding functions.  Similarly it is 
    important to use the code page conversion function 
    language_internalToPlatform to ensure that the map engine results 
    can be interpreted correctly at the application level. */
